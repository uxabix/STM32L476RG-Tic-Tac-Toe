# Tic-Tac-Toe on STM32L476RG

This project is a team-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game developed for the STM32L476RG microcontroller using the C programming language and the STM32 HAL library. It was created in January 2025 as part of the **Computer Architecture** (*Architektura Komputer√≥w*) course during the **3rd semester of studies at Politechnika Bia≈Çostocka**.

The game features a graphical interface rendered on an OLED display and is controlled through a computer keyboard using **USART** serial communication.

- **Display:** OLED screen with SSD1306/SSD1309 driver via I2C
- **Computer:** Required for serial input and power

## üìÅ Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main directories:

-   `Core/`: Contains the core application source code.
    -   `Inc/`: Header files (`.h`) for the application logic, drivers, and configuration.
    -   `Src/`: Source files (`.c`) implementing the game logic, display rendering, and hardware interaction.
-   `Drivers/`: STM32 HAL library files and CMSIS drivers.

### Key Files in `Core/Src/`:
-   `main.c`: The main application entry point, containing the main game loop and state machine.
-   `drawField.c`: Handles all rendering of the game board and pieces on the OLED display.
-   `fieldController.c`: Manages the state of the game board array.
-   `minimax.c`: Implements the AI logic for the single-player mode.
-   `winChecks.c`: Contains functions to check for win, lose, or draw conditions.

## üß© Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Open in STM32CubeIDE:**
    -   Launch STM32CubeIDE.
    -   Select `File > Import...`.
    -   Choose `General > Existing Projects into Workspace` and click `Next`.
    -   Browse to the cloned repository's root directory.
    -   Ensure the project is selected and click `Finish`.
3.  **Build the Project:**
    -   Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer.
    -   Select `Build Project`.
4.  **Flash the Microcontroller:**
    -   Connect the STM32 Nucleo board to your computer via USB.
    -   Click the `Run` button in STM32CubeIDE (or `Run > Run`) to flash the built program to the board.

## Usage

1.  **Connect a Serial Terminal:**
    -   Connect to the ST-Link's Virtual COM Port from your computer using a terminal emulator (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term, minicom).
    -   Use the following settings:
        -   **Baud Rate:** 115200
        -   **Data Bits:** 8
        -   **Parity:** None
        -   **Stop Bits:** 1
2.  **Game Controls:**
    -   `w`: Move cursor up
    -   `s`: Move cursor down
    -   `a`: Move cursor left
    -   `d`: Move cursor right
    -   `Enter`: Confirm selection / Place a piece
    -   `q`: Quit the current game and return to the main menu
